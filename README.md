HACC4Edu Hackathon

## Reverse Pitches:

### Malama Maunalua

- need to restore Mainalua bay
- invase algae
- need better communication
- GPS referred site (Maps API)
- figure out plots on land
* use Google Maps API to pinpoint location then broadcast location vis AWS SNS to others
- when they were out there, how many bags of algae they collected, how long they worked on removing algae
- how many bags of algae was removed
- website, phone calls communication
- be able to grab and store data to be fed to other organizations



### Hawaii Green Growth

- data.hawaii.gov
- 



### Oahu Invasive Species Committee

- figure out a way to raise awareness on what an ohia tree is
- websites, campaign, metrics, stats (like island power)
- social tagging for Ohia health (tag infeced trees on hikes)
* could possibly use a Reddit format to upvote/downvote infected trees around the area
