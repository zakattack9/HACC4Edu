## Reverse Pitches:

### Malama Maunalua

- need to restore Maunalua bay
- invasive algae
- need better communication
- GPS referred site (Maps API)
- figure out plots on land
* use Google Maps API to pinpoint location then broadcast location vis AWS SNS to others
- when they were out there, how many bags of algae they collected, how long they worked on removing algae
- how many bags of algae was removed
- website, phone calls communication
- be able to grab and store data to be fed to other organizations
- can data be used for anything else?
- A: track how fast is algae coming back
- what does one bag equate to as far as benefit?

- how do they currently manage plot assignment?
- rope off area, 29 plots, 50 plots targeted
- notify for loadtime, events
- removed ex amount of bags and how much pounds removed
- 3.5 million pounds
- plot removal competition


### Hawaii Green Growth

- data.hawaii.gov 



### Oahu Invasive Species Committee

- figure out a way to raise awareness on what an ohia tree is
- websites, campaign, metrics, stats (like island power)
- social tagging for Ohia health (tag infeced trees on hikes)
* could possibly use a Reddit format to upvote/downvote infected trees around the area


#### Notes
- tracking algae impacts
- why it is important to clear algae (ex. save monkseals)
- how does algae affect coral
- figure out what algaes are dominant in an area when users submit completion
